# Exercism repository template

The idea is to automate installation of everything required for the solving
exercises on exercism.

## How to start

You must have docker installed and running.

1. Run `bin/configure <YOUR_TOKEN>` (you can get your token in [1](settings))
2. Download your exercise, e.g. `bin/exercism download --track=java --exercise=hello-world`
